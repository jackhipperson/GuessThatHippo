# Guess That Hippo

"Guess That Hippo" is a guessing game based on baby photos of my 3 kids: Noah, Louis, and Lucas. This project was created to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it my very first significant coding endeavor since 2004! But also so that I could get my family to play the game and see how they reacted.

Join the fun and put your baby photo recognition skills to the test! Obviously if you don't know my kids then it will be very challenging!

I'm aware that having baby photos online may be a privacy issue, however these photos are strictly of their faces and none of the children are recognisable from these photos. They were all 3 months or under when the photos were taken.

## How to Play

- There are 10 rounds in "Guess That Hippo."
- Each round presents you with a baby photo, and you must guess whether the adorable baby in the picture is Noah, Louis, or Lucas.
- Make your selection by clicking the corresponding button beneath the photo.
- Your choice will be evaluated, and the game will inform you if you were correct. If you were wrong the correct answer will turn green.
- After completing all 10 rounds, you'll receive a final score out of 10. Can you get a perfect score?

## Features

- Fun and interactive gameplay: Enjoy a captivating guessing game with cute baby photos.
- Clean user interface: The game is designed with HTML and styled using CSS for a clean visual experience.
- Score tracking: Challenge yourself to improve your score with each playthrough.
