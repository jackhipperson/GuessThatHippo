# Guess That Hippo

"Guess That Hippo" is a delightful guessing game based on baby photos of my 3 kids: Noah, Louis, and Lucas. This project was created to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it my very first significant coding endeavor since 2004! Join the fun and put your baby photo recognition skills to the test!
